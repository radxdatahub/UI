                            The NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Data Hub (RADx Data Hub) supports researchers in accessing curated and
                            de-identified COVID-19 data, allowing them to find, aggregate, and perform data analyses in a cloud-enabled
                            platform.

                        <p>
                            The RADx Data Hub supports efforts to understand COVID-19 and factors associated with disparities in COVID-19
                            morbidity and mortality in underserved and vulnerable populations. To do this, the RADx Data Hub seeks to
                            accelerate scientific solutions and innovations in the development, commercialization, and implementation of
                            technologies for COVID-19 testing by providing de-identified COVID-19-related data, algorithms, and other
                            capabilities generated by various digital health solutions and technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The RADx Data Hub allows researchers to share the results of their analyses and relevant data, collaborate with
                            other members of the research community, and make use of AI machine learning algorithm research that supports
                            their individual contributions.

                        Sharing RADx data and results as rapidly as possible will allow researchers to conduct secondary analyses and
                        address issues related to the difficulties with the detection and prevention of community spread for COVID-19,
                        ultimately leading to rapid development of new technologies needed to move the nation beyond the pandemic. As such,
                        the RADx Data Hub supports the following RADx Coordinating and Data Collection Centers (C)DCCs, which collect and
                        share a wide variety of COVID-related research data and technologies:
