                        The NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Data Hub (RADx Data Hub) is a centralized data repository that provides
                        access to analytic tools and de-identified COVID-19 data from the RADx Initiative. The RADx Data Hub better supports
                        scientific efforts to understand COVID-19 and factors associated with disparities in morbidity and mortality in
                        underserved and vulnerable populations, by allowing researchers to discover, access, and perform analyses of
                        COVID-19 datasets in a cloud-enabled platform.

                        The RADx Data Hub contains several different features to help you get the most out of the system and better meet
                        your research needs. These include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li className={classes.tutorialListItem}>
                            <b>Common Page Navigation Tools:</b> The RADx Data Hub features navigation tools (e.g. the navigation bar, the
                            footer) that will lead you to different pages and features within the Hub.
                        </li>
                        <li className={classes.tutorialListItem}>
                            <b>Home Page:</b> The Home page is a one-stop shop for many of the key resources on the RADx Data Hub. From this
                            page, you can quickly reach educational documents (e.g. the Frequently Asked Questions [FAQ], the User
                            Tutorial), get information on news, funding opportunities, events, and study updates, search for studies, and
                            view statistics on the information in the Hub.
                        </li>

                            <b>Study Explorer:</b> The Study Explorer contains a number of discovery features (e.g. search, sorting,
                            filtering) to help you quickly and easily find studies.
                        </li>
                        <li className={classes.tutorialListItem}>
                            <b>Study Overview Pages:</b> Each study in the RADx Data Hub has its own Study Overview page, which contains
                            study metadata, variables, data files, and downloadable documents.

                            <b>Variables Catalog:</b> This tabular resource lists all variables in each data file for each study. By viewing
                            this resource, you can gain a deeper understanding of the key variables in a study to help you determine whether
                            it aligns with your research goals before requesting access to the study.
                        </li>
