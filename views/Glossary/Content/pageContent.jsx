                            measurement, ensuring that the data can be effectively analyzed, compared, and combined for meaningful insights
                            and decision-making.

                            Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to
                            be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means. Further, PII is defined as information: (i) that
                            directly identifies an individual (e.g., name, address, social security number or other identifying number or
                            code, telephone number, email address, etc.) or (ii) by which an agency intends to identify specific individuals
                            in conjunction with other data elements, i.e., indirect identification. (These data elements may include a
                            combination of gender, race, birth date, geographic indicator, and other descriptors). Additionally, information
                            permitting the physical or online contacting of a specific individual is the same as personally identifiable
                            information. This information can be maintained in either paper, electronic or other media.
